# README for `data` Folder - Jetpack Compose, MVVM, and Clean Architecture

## Overview
This `data` folder is part of an Android application built using Clean Architecture principles, the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, and Jetpack Compose for the UI. It serves as the data layer, responsible for managing data sources, repositories, services, models, and entities to ensure a clean separation of concerns between the application's business logic, UI, and data management. The structure promotes modularity, testability, and scalability while adhering to Clean Architecture's dependency rules.

## Folder Structure
Below is an explanation of the key components and files in the `data` folder:

### 1. `database`
- **Purpose**: Contains code related to local data persistence, typically using Room (a Jetpack library).
- **Key Files**: Includes the database instance, defining entities and data access objects (DAOs) for storing and retrieving data locally.

### 2. `dao`
- **Purpose**: Houses Data Access Objects (DAOs) that provide an abstraction layer for accessing and manipulating data in the database.
- **Key Files**: Contains DAO interfaces or classes for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on specific entities.

### 3. `entities`
- **Purpose**: Contains data models or entities representing the structure of data stored in the local database or retrieved from remote sources.
- **Key Files**: Includes entity classes (e.g., data classes annotated for Room) that map to database tables or API responses.

### 4. `models`
- **Purpose**: Holds data models or DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used for representing data structures, often for remote API responses or intermediate data transformations.
- **Key Files**: Includes classes for representing specific data types, such as general data, detailed response objects, and success response structures.

### 5. `repositories`
- **Purpose**: Contains repository interfaces or implementations that act as the single source of truth for data, orchestrating data from local (database) and remote (API) sources.
- **Key Files**: Includes implementations for managing specific types of data, bridging local and remote data sources to ensure consistency.

### 6. `services`
- **Purpose**: Contains network-related services or APIs, typically using Retrofit or OkHttp, for fetching data from remote sources.
- **Key Files**: Includes packages or modules for specific data categories, service interfaces defining API endpoints, and utility classes for handling network call results (e.g., success, error, loading states).

## Key Principles
- **Clean Architecture**: The `data` layer is isolated from the `domain` and `presentation` layers, ensuring that data-related concerns (e.g., database operations, API calls) are separate from business logic and UI. Outer layers depend on inner layers, not vice versa.
- **MVVM**: Works closely with the ViewModel layer to provide data to the UI, enabling reactive updates for Jetpack Compose using state management tools like State, StateFlow, or LiveData.
- **Jetpack Compose Integration**: Supports Jetpack Compose indirectly by providing data models, repositories, and services that feed into the UI layer through ViewModels, ensuring a seamless and reactive user interface.

## Dependencies
This layer typically relies on:
- **Room Database**: For local data persistence.
- **Retrofit or OkHttp**: For remote data fetching via APIs.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: For asynchronous data operations.
- **Dagger/Hilt**: For dependency injection to provide instances of repositories, services, DAOs, or databases.
- **Kotlin Serialization or Gson**: For parsing JSON responses from APIs into Kotlin data models.

## How to Use
1. **Database Operations**: Use the database instance and DAOs to manage local data storage and retrieval.
2. **Network Calls**: Use service interfaces to define and execute API calls for remote data, handling responses with utility classes for network results.
3. **Data Models**: Utilize model classes to represent and transform data from APIs or databases.
4. **Repositories**: Leverage repository implementations to orchestrate data from local and remote sources, providing a unified data access point for the `domain` layer.
5. **Entities**: Define or extend entities to match your database schema or API response structure, ensuring consistency across data layers.

## Best Practices
- Keep data classes immutable where possible (e.g., use `data class` in Kotlin).
- Use suspend functions for coroutines to handle asynchronous operations cleanly.
- Ensure thread safety for database and network operations (e.g., use `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` for Room, `Dispatchers.Main` for UI updates).
- Write unit tests for repositories, DAOs, and services to verify data operations and network responses.
- Use sealed classes or enums for robust error handling and state management.

## Example Workflow
1. Fetch data from a remote API using a service interface.
2. Store or retrieve data locally using the database and DAOs.
3. Transform the data into domain models in a repository (often in a separate `domain` module).
4. Provide the transformed data to the ViewModel, which exposes it to the Jetpack Compose UI for rendering.

## Notes
- This folder assumes a multi-module project structure, with `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` (or similar) separated for better organization and scalability.
- For UI-specific implementations, refer to the `presentation` layer, which integrates with Jetpack Compose and ViewModels to consume data from this layer.
