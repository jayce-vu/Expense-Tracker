# README for `di` Folder - Dependency Injection

## Overview
This `di` folder is part of an Android application and is dedicated to managing dependency injection (DI) using a framework like Dagger or Hilt. It ensures that components, such as repositories, services, databases, and use cases, are properly initialized, provided, and injected into other layers of the application (e.g., data, domain, and presentation layers). The folder supports a clean, modular architecture, enabling scalability, testability, and maintainability.

## Folder Structure
Below is an explanation of the key components and files in the `di` folder:

### 1. `DatabaseModule`
- **Purpose**: Defines the dependency injection configuration for database-related components, such as Room databases and their DAOs (Data Access Objects).
- **Key Files**: Includes classes or objects (e.g., `@Module` or `@Provides` annotations in Dagger/Hilt) that provide instances of databases and related dependencies for use across the app.

### 2. `Modules.kt`
- **Purpose**: A central file (or set of files) that aggregates or defines dependency injection modules, ensuring a cohesive configuration for the application’s components.
- **Key Files**: Contains Kotlin code with module definitions, bindings, or component setups, often using annotations like `@InstallIn`, `@Provides`, or `@Binds` to configure DI scopes (e.g., application, activity, or fragment scope).

### 3. `RepoModule`
- **Purpose**: Manages the dependency injection for repository-related components, which act as the single source of truth for data in the application.
- **Key Files**: Includes classes or objects that provide instances of repositories, ensuring they are injected into use cases, ViewModels, or other layers as needed.

### 4. `ServiceHelperModule`
- **Purpose**: Handles the dependency injection for helper or utility services that assist with network operations, data processing, or other service-related tasks.
- **Key Files**: Contains classes or objects providing instances of helper services, often used in conjunction with network or API services.

### 5. `ServiceModule`
- **Purpose**: Configures dependency injection for network-related services, such as API clients (e.g., Retrofit) or other remote data access components.
- **Key Files**: Includes classes or objects that provide instances of network services, ensuring they are available for injection into repositories or other data components.

### 6. `UseCaseModule`
- **Purpose**: Defines the dependency injection for use cases (or interactors) in the domain layer, which encapsulate business logic and interact with repositories.
- **Key Files**: Contains classes or objects providing instances of use cases, ensuring they can be injected into ViewModels or other presentation components.

## Key Principles
- **Dependency Injection**: Promotes loose coupling by allowing components to be injected rather than created directly, improving testability and maintainability.
- **Modularity**: Each module focuses on a specific part of the application (e.g., database, repositories, services), making it easier to manage dependencies and scale the codebase.
- **Clean Architecture**: Aligns with Clean Architecture by ensuring that dependencies flow inward (e.g., presentation depends on domain, which depends on data), with DI facilitating this structure.

## Dependencies
This folder typically relies on:
- **Dagger or Hilt**: For implementing dependency injection, with Hilt being the preferred choice for Android due to its integration with Jetpack libraries.
- **Kotlin**: For writing concise and type-safe DI configurations using Kotlin classes, objects, or annotations.
- **Other Layers**: Integrates with the `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` layers to provide their respective components (e.g., databases, repositories, ViewModels).

## How to Use
1. **Module Configuration**: Use the module files (e.g., `DatabaseModule`, `RepoModule`) to define how dependencies are created and provided using annotations like `@Provides`, `@Binds`, or `@Inject`.
2. **Component Injection**: Inject dependencies into classes (e.g., ViewModels, repositories, services) using `@Inject` constructors or field injection, as configured in the modules.
3. **Scope Management**: Apply appropriate scopes (e.g., `@Singleton`, `@ActivityScoped`) to ensure components have the desired lifecycle and are reused or recreated as needed.
4. **Integration**: Ensure the `Modules.kt` file (or similar) ties together all modules into a cohesive DI setup, often installed in an application-level component (e.g., `SingletonComponent` with `@InstallIn(ApplicationComponent::class)`).

## Best Practices
- Keep modules small and focused on specific responsibilities (e.g., one module per major component type).
- Use interfaces for dependencies where possible to facilitate mocking and testing.
- Avoid circular dependencies by carefully designing the module structure and dependency graph.
- Write unit tests for your DI setup to verify that components are injected correctly and behave as expected.
- Use Hilt’s generated components and modules to minimize boilerplate code and ensure type safety.

## Example Workflow
1. Define a database instance in `DatabaseModule` using `@Provides` to create and provide a Room database.
2. Configure a repository in `RepoModule` to inject the database and any required services, making it available for use cases.
3. Set up a network service in `ServiceModule` to provide an API client (e.g., Retrofit) for remote data access.
4. Create use cases in `UseCaseModule` that inject repositories, encapsulating business logic for the `domain` layer.
5. Inject these dependencies into ViewModels or other components in the `presentation` layer, ensuring seamless data flow to the UI (e.g., Jetpack Compose).

## Notes
- This folder assumes a multi-module project structure, with `di` working in tandem with `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` to provide a fully integrated dependency injection system.
- For UI-specific dependency needs (e.g., ViewModels), consider additional modules or integration with Hilt’s ViewModel injection capabilities.
