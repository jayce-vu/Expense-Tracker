# README for `domain` Folder - Clean Architecture

## Overview
This `domain` folder is a core part of an Android application, following Clean Architecture principles. It serves as the business logic layer, encapsulating the application's core rules, use cases, and data models, independent of UI, external data sources, or platforms. The folder ensures that the application’s logic remains reusable, testable, and decoupled from implementation details like databases, APIs, or UI frameworks.

## Folder Structure
Below is an explanation of the key components and files in the `domain` folder:

### 1. `mappers`
- **Purpose**: Contains classes or functions responsible for transforming data between different layers (e.g., from data models to domain models or vice versa).
- **Key Files**:
    - Includes mapper classes or extension functions (e.g., in Kotlin) that convert external data (e.g., from the `data` layer) into domain-specific models.
    - Examples might include mapping success responses or specific data types into domain entities.

### 2. `repositories`
- **Purpose**: Defines interfaces for repositories that act as the single source of truth for data, abstracting data access from the `data` layer. These interfaces are implemented in the `data` layer but used here to ensure the domain layer remains independent.
- **Key Files**:
    - Includes repository interfaces for specific data domains, ensuring the domain logic can interact with data without knowing its source (e.g., local database or remote API).

### 3. `usecase`
- **Purpose**: Contains use cases (or interactors) that encapsulate the business logic of the application. These are the entry points for the domain layer, interacting with repositories to perform specific operations or queries.
- **Key Files**:
    - Includes use case classes or interfaces for various operations, such as retrieving data, checking favorites, or managing favorites.
    - Each use case typically includes an implementation that interacts with repositories and returns results (e.g., using coroutines or Flow for asynchronous operations).

### 4. `specific_category`
- **Purpose**: A subpackage or module within `usecase` focused on a specific category of business logic, grouping related use cases together for better organization.
- **Key Files**:
    - Includes use cases specific to that category, such as retrieving information, checking favorite status, or managing favorites.

## Key Principles
- **Clean Architecture**: The `domain` layer is the heart of the application, independent of external concerns like UI or data sources. It depends only on its own models, repositories, and use cases.
- **Business Logic**: Encapsulates the core rules and operations of the application, ensuring they are reusable across platforms or UI frameworks.
- **Testability**: Designed to be easily unit-tested, as it avoids dependencies on Android SDK classes or external frameworks, relying instead on interfaces and plain Kotlin code.

## Dependencies
This layer typically relies on:
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: For asynchronous operations in use cases (e.g., `suspend` functions or `Flow`).
- **Kotlin Data Classes**: For defining domain models or entities that represent the application's data in a type-safe manner.
- **Repository Interfaces**: Defined here but implemented in the `data` layer, ensuring loose coupling and dependency inversion.
- **Mappers**: For transforming data between layers, maintaining separation between domain models and external data formats.

## How to Use
1. **Define Domain Models**: Use mappers to create or transform domain-specific models from data provided by the `data` layer.
2. **Implement Repositories**: Define repository interfaces here, which will be implemented in the `data` layer to handle data operations.
3. **Create Use Cases**: Develop use cases to encapsulate business logic, such as retrieving data, checking or managing favorites, or performing other domain-specific operations. Use cases interact with repositories to fetch or modify data.
4. **Integration**: The `presentation` layer (e.g., ViewModels) uses these use cases to execute business logic and expose results to the UI.

## Best Practices
- Keep domain models immutable where possible (e.g., use `data class` in Kotlin).
- Use interfaces for repositories to ensure the domain layer remains decoupled from data implementations.
- Write use cases as single-responsibility functions or classes, focusing on specific business operations.
- Avoid platform-specific dependencies (e.g., Android SDK, Jetpack libraries) to maintain portability and testability.
- Use Kotlin coroutines or Flow for asynchronous operations, ensuring non-blocking and reactive behavior.

## Example Workflow
1. Define a domain model in the `mappers` package, using a mapper function to convert data from the `data` layer into this model.
2. Create a repository interface in the `repositories` package, which the `data` layer will implement.
3. Implement a use case in the `usecase` or `specific_category` package, injecting the repository and using it to fetch or manipulate data.
4. Expose the use case result (e.g., via a `Flow` or `suspend` function) to the `presentation` layer, where it’s consumed by a ViewModel and displayed in the UI.

## Notes
- This folder assumes a multi-module project structure, with `domain` working alongside `data` (for data access) and `presentation` (for UI) to create a fully decoupled architecture.
- For UI-specific implementations, refer to the `presentation` layer, which integrates with the UI framework to consume domain logic.
