# README for `network` Folder

## Overview
This `network` folder is part of an Android application and is dedicated to handling network-related functionality, such as API calls, HTTP requests, and network configuration. It typically uses libraries like Retrofit, OkHttp, or other HTTP clients to manage communication with remote servers, ensuring robust, scalable, and maintainable network operations. The folder is designed to integrate seamlessly with other layers (e.g., `data` and `domain`) while keeping network concerns isolated.

## Folder Structure
Below is an explanation of the key components and files in the `network` folder:

### 1. `interceptor`
- **Purpose**: Contains classes or functions that intercept and modify HTTP requests or responses, adding custom logic such as headers, authentication, or network connectivity checks.
- **Key Files**:
    - Includes interceptor classes that implement the `Interceptor` interface (e.g., from OkHttp) to handle specific network behaviors.
    - Examples might include adding headers to requests or checking network connectivity before making API calls.

## Key Principles
- **Network Isolation**: Keeps network logic separate from business logic (handled in the `domain` layer) and data storage (handled in the `data` layer), ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support multiple API endpoints, authentication strategies, and network conditions, making it easy to extend or modify network behavior.
- **Reliability**: Implements interceptors and configurations to handle network errors, retries, timeouts, and connectivity issues gracefully.

## Dependencies
This layer typically relies on:
- **OkHttp**: For HTTP client functionality, including interceptors, caching, and connection management.
- **Retrofit**: For building type-safe HTTP clients and defining API interfaces.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: For asynchronous network calls (e.g., `suspend` functions).
- **Kotlin Serialization or Gson**: For parsing JSON responses from APIs into Kotlin data models.
- **Other Libraries**: May include tools for logging, error handling, or authentication (e.g., OAuth libraries).

## How to Use
1. **Configure Interceptors**: Use interceptor classes to add custom behavior to HTTP requests, such as adding authentication headers, logging requests/responses, or checking network connectivity.
2. **Define API Services**: Typically, this folder works in tandem with a `services` or `api` package (often in the `data` layer) to define and implement API endpoints using Retrofit, which relies on the network configuration here.
3. **Handle Network Calls**: Use coroutines or callbacks to execute network requests asynchronously, ensuring the UI remains responsive.
4. **Integration**: The network layer provides data to the `data` layer (e.g., repositories) or directly to the `domain` layer via mappers, which then exposes it to the `presentation` layer (e.g., ViewModels for Jetpack Compose).

## Best Practices
- Keep interceptors focused on specific responsibilities (e.g., one interceptor for headers, another for connectivity checks).
- Use immutable configurations where possible to prevent unintended modifications during runtime.
- Implement retry logic, timeouts, and error handling to manage unreliable network conditions.
- Write unit and integration tests for interceptors and network configurations to ensure reliability and correct behavior.
- Avoid hardcoding API keys, endpoints, or other sensitive data—use secure storage or build configurations instead.

## Example Workflow
1. Create an interceptor (e.g., a header interceptor) to add authentication tokens or custom headers to every HTTP request.
2. Implement a network connectivity interceptor to check if the device is online before making API calls, preventing unnecessary requests.
3. Configure OkHttp with these interceptors and use Retrofit to define API interfaces for remote data access.
4. Use the configured network client in the `data` layer to fetch data, which is then transformed and provided to the `domain` and `presentation` layers.

## Notes
- This folder assumes integration with a broader architecture, such as Clean Architecture, where `network` supports the `data` layer’s remote data fetching needs.
- For local data persistence or business logic, refer to the `data` and `domain` layers, respectively, while the `presentation` layer (e.g., with Jetpack Compose) consumes the results.
